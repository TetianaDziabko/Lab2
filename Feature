Feature: Sort Customers by Last Name
  In order to efficiently manage customer records
  As a bank manager
  I want to sort the customer list by their last name

  Scenario: Successfully sort the customer list by last name in descending order
    Given I am on the Bank Manager Login page
    When I log in as "Bank Manager"
    And I navigate to the "Customers" tab
    And I click on the "Last Name" column header
    Then the customer list should be sorted in descending order of last names
